Using Google Maps API to Locate and Put a marker

This is a project based on a Google Map js sample. Use the Google Map API to locate users and leave a mark on their location so that users can record their historical location.

User stories:
1. As a traveller, I need map markers to record the places I have visited.
2. As a computer user, I need a webpage to check my computer's location capabilities.
3. As someone who needs to use VPN, a simple platform is needed to verify whether the current IP address has been successfully changed.

MVP：
1. Locate the user's current location.
2. Put a marker.
